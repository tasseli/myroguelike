planning

Main list of issues that would merit fixing or rewriting:
- adding messages to bottom UI
  - removing the dash row as it's visually not needed
- adding melee
- adding knowledge, first levels
- adding discussion
- adding key handling for fun commands like look, say, tickle, hit
- adding help keys

Ideas
load map from file
map generation
agent knowledge
agent communication (language, )
agent faction
faction knowledge
faction communication
cultures for groups?
languages based on INT
bartering based on language / abilities
"Look at ..." "It doesn't make sense to you" / "you see another Dwarven healer with a spellbook of second circle on their backpack, probably"It would be very cool if there'd be stat potions lying around, and raising a stat did show, but everything else changed based on the stats.

 Easy steps for refactoring
- refactor game loop 
- plan map logic, say, for handling items etc
- consider game manager class
- modularize rendering logic
- consider game states

 pygame.display.set_mode()	can be used to create the grid
 pygame.Surface			represents an off-screen image I can draw before blitting it to display. Frames, as it were.
 pygame.event.get()		capture inputs. Most commands use up a turn, some don't.
 pygame.font.Font()		creating font object to render text
 font.render()			converting ASCII to images
 pygame.time.Clock()		control speed of the game. Handling frame rate, checking for input.
 screen.blit()			Draw surface
 pygame.display.update()	Updates the contents of the display after drawing everything. Update the screen after action or turn.
 Game loop idea:		1 capture input 2 update game state 3 render new state 4 wait for next input
